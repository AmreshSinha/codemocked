# Codemocked

Codemocked is a Self-hostable open-source IDE.

## Installation

The repository is a monorepo handled using Turborepo.

I will surely add the installation step once the project starts stacking up.

## Usage

Obviously you have to do this:

```bash
yarn install
```

Note: Check the scripts in root `package.json`
